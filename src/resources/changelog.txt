Basic Concept:
    - Track Players Playtime using the Statistic "PLAY_ONE_MINUTE"
    - Compare the Statistic Value to different Values of Different Rewards
    - Types of Rewards:
        - REAL_TIME     : Uses the Real World Clock, is always incrementing even if the Server is offline
        - SESSION_TIME  : Calculate a Session Time using the Total Playertime and a Cached Playertime from Login
        - PLAY_TIME     : Uses the Statistic "PLAY_ONE_MINUTE"

    - PlayerData File Storage, add a last saved timestamp to each File
        - Run an async, scheduled routine to clean up older PlayerData to free up diskspace & preventing folder cluttering
        - Is this useful?
    - Easy Input Format for time - Example (Simatic):
        - T#5d20h23m56s -> calculates to the corresponding amount of ms
        - Available Time keys (Case-sensitive!):
            - #D -> Days
            - #h -> Hours
            - #m -> Minutes
            - #s -> Seconds
    - GUI to create/modify & manage Rewards
