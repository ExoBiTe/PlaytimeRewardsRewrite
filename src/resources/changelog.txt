Changelog Version 0.1.2:
    - Added a Config.yml
        - Value "EnableUpdateCheck" (boolean) controls whether the Plugin Notifies the Admins about a new Plugin Version
        - Value "DataSaveInterval" (timeString) controls the Automatic Save Interval (-1 Disables the Autosave)
        - Hidden Value "debug_allowDebugTools" (boolean) allows the access to the DebugTools
        - Hidden Value "ColorCode" (char) sets the color code for the whole Plugin

    - Added a bunch of new Permissions
        - Changed the Permission "timerewards.cmd.playtime.own" to "playtimerewards.cmd.playtime.own"
        - Added the following Permissions:
            - playtimerewards.*
            - playtimerewards.notifyOnUpdate
            - playtimerewards.cmd.playtime.other

    - Added an Auto Updater using the Spiget-API
        - For now it only checks for new Updates, it doesn't download them automatically.
        - Maybe i'll add this in the Future-
        - Players with the new Permission "playtimerewards.notifyOnUpdate" get a Notification upon login

        - Allows me (the Developer) to send MOTD's to ServerOwners, Notifying them about Hotfixes or similar stuff.
