Hello there... again. Welcome (back... again) to [I]PlaytimeRewards[/I]!
This Plugin is a re-write of my "older" [URL='https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/32900/']PlaytimeRewards[/URL].

I coded this Plugin completely new from scratch, removing unnecessary Features from the old Plugin and made it overall easier to read & maintain (at least in my opinion).
And to be honest - i lost the sourcecode of the previous Version, as I didn't upload that one to github... oops.

What does this Plugin?
- This Plugin counts the Playtime for every of your Players and Rewards them when and how you configure it.

How does it Rewards the Players?
- You can choose! You can customize the Rewards as you want, from just rewarding a Player at fixed times, you may also reward them once every 24 Hours or

What can the Players obtain?
- Again, you can choose it. For now it supports Console Commands upon receiving the Reward. It also supporst some comsetic stuff like Particles and Sounds.
Later - out of the Beta it´ll also support Items and maybe other stuff you guys suggest me (altough nothing you couldn´t do with Console Commands).

Supports [URL='https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/6245/']PlaceholderAPI[/URL]!

[SPOILER="Placeholders"]
[code]- %ptr_playtime% -> Returns the Playtime for the Player, the message format is defined as 'EXT_PAPI_TIME_FORMAT'
- %ptr_sessiontime% -> Returns the Sessiontime for the Player, the message format is defined as 'EXT_PAPI_TIME_FORMAT'
- %ptr_playtime_days%: Returns the Total Playtime in Days
- %ptr_playtime_hours%: Returns the Total Playtime in Hours
- %ptr_playtime_minutes%: Returns the Total Playtime in Minutes
- %ptr_playtime_seconds%: Returns the Total Playtime in Seconds
- %ptr_sessiontime_days%: Returns the Total Sessiontime in Days
- %ptr_sessiontime_hours%: Returns the Total Sessiontime in Days
- %ptr_sessiontime_minutes%: Returns the Total Sessiontime in Days
- %ptr_sessiontime_seconds%: Returns the Total Sessiontime in Days
- %ptr_playtime_days_trimmed%: Returns the Days-Amount from the Total Playtime
- %ptr_playtime_hours_trimmed%: Returns the Hours-Amount from the Total Playtime
- %ptr_playtime_minutes_trimmed%: Returns the Minutes-Amount from the Total Playtime
- %ptr_playtime_seconds_trimmed%: Returns the Seconds-Amount from the Total Playtime
- %ptr_sessiontime_days_trimmed%: Returns the Days-Amount from the Total Sessiontime
- %ptr_sessiontime_hours_trimmed%: Returns the Hours-Amount from the Total Sessiontime
- %ptr_sessiontime_minutes_trimmed%: Returns the Minutes-Amount from the Total Sessiontime
- %ptr_sessiontime_seconds_trimmed%: Returns the Seconds-Amount from the Total Sessiontime[/code]

[SPOILER="Trimmed Explanation:"]
If [icode]%PTR_PLAYTIME%[/icode] would return [icode]12d3h50m23s[/icode] for Player x (or something similiar, format defined in lang.yml),

[icode]%PTR_PLAYTIME_HOURS%[/icode] would return [icode]291h[/icode] for Player x.

But [icode]%PTR_PLAYTIME_HOURS_TRIMMED%[/icode] would just return [icode]3h[/icode] for Player x, as its only the "Hours-Part" of the Total Playtime
[/SPOILER]
[/SPOILER]


[SPOILER="F.A.Q & Future Plans"]
Q: I am using one of your older PlaytimeRewards. Is there way to transport Data inbetween these to Plugins?
A: [I]No, there isn´t. This Plugin is a completely different Software, the only Thing they have in common is their Name.[/I]

Q: Does this Plugin work with Version older than 1.17.1?
A: [I]Theoretically yes, but this Plugin got compiled with Java17 to use some newer Features so it wo't run on older servers that don't use Java 17.(You may also take this as a No - for now).
If many People are interested in older Version support, i may add a compatible Version.[/I]

Q: How does this Plugin save its data?
A: [I]A playerData.yml File will get created when the Plugin tries to save userdata. It will try to take as little space up as possible. Data get's also saved uising Players UUIDs rather than their Name, to keep up with Namechanges.[/I]

Q: Does this Plugin work with /reload?
A: [I]This is a.. topic... Theoretically it was designed with the ability to support server reloads, but i didn´t test it that much during development as it later wasn't that big of a priority anymore.[/I]

Future Plans:
[code]- Support Custom Advancements
- An ingame Reward-Editor using Inventory GUIs
- Add OfflineTime - Use Time between Logout and Login
- Add AFK-Time[/code]
If you´ve got any ideas feel free to suggest them in the Discussions or via pn!

Welcome to the Configuration area. There are three Configurable Files, the config.yml, the rewards.yml and the lang.yml.

The config.yml File contains all our 'overall'-Plugin Configuration:
[SPOILER="config.yml"]
[code=YAML]
#Configuration File for PlaytimeRewards@https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/100231/ by ExoBite

#This Option only Notifies you when a New Version is available, it doesn't download anything.

#This Option downloads the latest Version of the Plugin and installs it upon a reboot.
AllowAutoUpdate: false

#The Amount of Players that get displayed by the Playtimetop-Command
PlaytimeTopAmount: 10

#Set to '-1' to Disable the Automatic Save Interval
DataSaveInterval: '1h30m'

#AFK-Block
AFK:
  #Enables or Disables the whole AFK-System.
  #When set to false, no other AFK-Value does anything.
  Enable: false

  #Here you can define, how much time needs to pass without an Action from the Player,
  #to flag the Player as AFK.
  Time: '10m'

  #Defines whether a Player Movement resets his AFK-Status
  CancelOnMove: true

  #Defines if a Players AFK-Status is reset by looking around
  CancelOnLook: true

  #Defines whether a Player Interaction resets his AFK-Status
  #(Interaction is any Sort of Right or Left Mouse Button Click)
  CancelOnInteract: true

  #Defines if Chatting resets the AFK-Status
  CancelOnChat: true

  #Defines if executing Commands resets the AFK-Status
  CancelOnCommand: true
[/code]
You may add additional Options to it, that are hidden in the normal Config:
[SPOILER="Additional Options"]
[code=YAML]#Specifies the Color-Code the Plugin should use
ColorCode: '§'[/code]
[/SPOILER]
[/SPOILER]

The rewards.yml File contains all reward data, let's dive into it:
[SPOILER="rewards.yml"]
[code=YAML]
#PlaytimeRewards@https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/100231/ by ExoBiTe
#
#List of all Sounds can be found here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Sound.html
#List of all SoundCategories can be found here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/SoundCategory.html
#List of all Particles can be found here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Particle.html
#
#Available CountTypes are PLAYTIME, SESSION_TIME and GLOBAL_TIME
#Time accepts Days(d), Hours(h), Minutes(m) and Seconds(s) and can be combined in any Variation, examples: '3d15m' or '1d25h35m12s'
#Pay Attention that the RewardName doesn't allow Duplicates!

SampleReward1: #No Duplicates allowed
  DisplayName: '§3I´m a cool §4Reward§3!' #The Visible Name Ingame
  CountType: 'PLAYTIME' #Specifies which type the Plugin counts
  Time: '1m30s' #accepts Days(d), Hours(h), Minutes(m) and Seconds(s)
  Repeating: true #Specifies if the Reward is obtainable once or if it gets granted multiple times (example: if time is 5s and Repeating is true, the Reward gets granted every 5s)
  GrantFirst: false #Specifies if the Reward is obtained instantly for the first Time, makes no sense with non-repeating Rewards
  PermissionNeeded: 'cool.long.time.player.rank' #The Permission needed in order to get this Reward
  ConsoleCommands: #Executes the specified PlaytimeCommand from the Console. Is Optional.
    - 'say <PLAYER> is a cool Person!'
  Display:
    PlayerMessages: #Sends the specified Messages to the Player which gets the Reward. Is Optional.
      - 'Congrats <PLAYER> upon Earning <REWARD>'
    GlobalMessages: #Sends the specified Messages to all Players. is Optional.
      - '<PLAYER> earned the Achievement <REWARD>'
    ActionbarMessage: '§1Hello §4<PLAYER>§1!'
    Particles: #Particles Parameters are defined in this Order: 'PARTICLE_NAME, Amount, offsetX, offsetY, offsetZ, extra' - extra refers often to the speed. Is Optional.
      - 'FLAME, 10, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 1'
    Sounds: #Sound Parameters are defines in this Order: 'SOUND_NAME, SOUND_CATEGORY, VOLUME, PITCH' Is Optional.
      - 'BLOCK_BELL_USE, PLAYERS, 1.0, 1.0'
[/code]
The default rewards.yml contains one example Reward. You may change it to your likings and can also add as many new Rewards as you want.
Every Row that has an "Is Optional" as Comment, can get removed if you don´t need it for your use-case, so you (hopefully) won´t clutter up that file with unused stuff.
Just make sure to give each reward a unique name, otherwise unwanted stuff [B]will[/B] happen.
[/SPOILER]

The lang.yml File customizes the Messages the Plugin will send to your Players. For now there isn´t really that much to see.
[SPOILER="lang.yml"]
[code=YAML]

# The Return Message from the /playtime Command
CMD_SUC_PT_OWN: |-
  Your Playtime is %[0]d %[1]h %[2]m %[3]s
  Your Sessiontime is %[4]d %[5]h %[6]m %[7]s

# The Return Message from the /playtime <player> Command
CMD_SUC_PT_OTHER: |-
  §6%[0]§a's Playtime is %[1]d %[2]h %[3]m %[4]s
  §6%[5]§a's Sessiontime is %[6]d %[7]h %[8]m %[9]s

# The Return Message from the /playtime <offlineplayer> Command
CMD_SUC_PT_OTHER_OFFLINE: §6%[0]§a's Playtime is %[1]d %[2]h %[3]m %[4]s

# The First Part of the /Playtimetop Command
CMD_SUC_PTTOP_HEADER: '§7Listing the top §b%[0] §7Playtimes:'

# This Message gets printed once for each Entry from the /Playtimetop Command
CMD_SUC_PTTOP_ENTRY: '§6%[0]§7: §b%[1]§7 - has played %[2]d %[3]h %[4]m and %[5]s'

# The first Part of the /Playtimerewards list Command
CMD_SUC_PTR_LIST_HEADER: |-
  §7Listing all §b%[0]§7 Rewards:
  §8Internal Name -- DisplayName -- CountType

# This Message gets printed once for each Entry from the /Playtimerewards list Command
CMD_SUC_PTR_LIST_ENTRY: §3%[0] §8-- §1%[1] §8-- §7%[2]

# The Return Message from the /Playtimerewards reload Command
CMD_SUC_PTR_RELOAD_SUCCESS: §aSuccessfully reloaded the external Data!

# A Error Message when too many Requests are sent from a Player using /pt <offlineplayer>
CMD_ERR_TOO_MANY_REQUESTS: §4You can't do that right now. Try again later!

# The No Permission Message from all Commands
CMD_ERR_NO_PERMISSION: §4You don't have the Permission to do this.

# The No-Player-Found Error Message from all Commands
CMD_ERR_PLAYER_NOT_FOUND: §4Can't find the Player '§6%[0]§4'!

# The Notification upon Login when a new Version is available
NOTIF_UPDATE_AVAILABLE: §6Version %[0] of PlaytimeRewards is available (Running v%[1])!

# The Message sent to Players who get flagged as afk
NOTIF_AFK_USER_WENT_AFK: §7You are now flagged as AFK

# The Message sent to Players when coming back
NOTIF_AFK_USER_CAME_BACK: §7You are no longer flagged as AFK

# The Format in which all Times get sent to the PlaceholderAPI
EXT_PAPI_TIME_FORMAT: '%[0]d %[1]h %[2]m %[3]s'


[/code]
This File is rather simple, you may change it to your likings.
Every "%[x]" represents a Parameter to be filled in later by the Plugin,
so make sure to use all Parameters for a Message in the correct order.

[U][B]HexColors![/B][/U]
This Plugin supports Hex-Colors in your lang.yml File (since Plugin v0.1.5).
Just edit your lang.yml File using the Following Syntax:

For Simple Hex Colors: [icode]§([HexColor]) [/icode]
[code=YAML]# The Return Message from the /playtime Command
CMD_SUC_PT_OWN: |-
  §(fc03ad)Your Playtime is %[0]d %[1]h %[2]m %[3]s
  Your Sessiontime is %[4]d %[5]h %[6]m %[7]s[/code]
This Code produces this Output:
[IMG]https://i.imgur.com/08PUAQ9.png[/IMG]



For Hex Color Ranges: [icode]§([HexRangeBeginning]-) [Some random Text] §(-[HexRangeEnding])[/icode]
[code=YAML]# The Return Message from the /playtime Command
CMD_SUC_PT_OWN: |-
  §(031cfc-)Your Playtime is %[0]d %[1]h %[2]m %[3]s
  Your Sessiontime is %[4]d %[5]h %[6]m %[7]s §(-fc03ad)[/code]
And this Code produces this Output:
[IMG]https://i.imgur.com/HbDeH0A.png[/IMG]


[/SPOILER]

All files will get automatically generated upon the first Plugin start & updated if there is new Stuff.
